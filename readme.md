## Bilingua Dealer is a server-less web-application which allows:

- Create a bilingua book (with original text, and some translation service like Google-translation).
- Read bilingua books.
- Edit bilingua books.
- Learn the foreign language, using additional functionality like "fragments".
- Listen the original text, using a speech-engine.
- It automatically copies the selected text (or the clicked word) to clipboard,
  so that you can integrate it with a dictionary, which can observe clipboard (GoldenDict, for example).
- Save the bilingua book as a json-file, import it from the json-file.
